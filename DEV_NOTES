- Multiple file support and hungry regex with -1 dict return should be good enough to handle more advanced configs like Apache + conf.d, possibly heavy on lots of regexs + files?

- How to handle iptables? open() content file on filesystem? Possible, but slightly ugly when location is user controlled. Try to get from iptables -L?

- System checks?
 + sshd
 + apache2 (timeout, tokens, indexes?, keepalive)
 + nginx (tokens)
 + iptables (unknown)
 + php (sessions, expose, url_fopen)
